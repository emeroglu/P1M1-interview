# P1M1 Developer Challange

### Steps to follow
- Replace "{your-path}\db.txt" with a valid path in the Test.cs file
- Make sure you have the following NuGet Packages
	- Newtonsoft.Json (Latest)
	- NUnit (2.7.0)
- Since NUnit3 is not allowed, we need the NUnit2 Test Adapter. The NUnit2 Adapter comes as a vsix rather than a NuGet Package for the latest Visual Studio 2017. You may install the extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnitTestAdapter

### Specs
- Visual Studio 2017 (15.8.9)
- .NET Framework 4.7.1
